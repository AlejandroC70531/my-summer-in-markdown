## Hello There!

![](/star-wars-obi-wan-kenobi.gif)

I'm Alejandro! I'm currently in 10th Grade, and this repository is for my Computer Science class! I am a mixture of Mexican, German, Dutch, and Polish and I love to explore my roots. I am very passionate about world history, cooking, nature, and cultures from around the world. This is my first ever repository, so I hope you'll enjoy it. For now, I will now dive into certain topics relating to what I did this Summer!

## Summer School

This year, I took my first ever Summer School class for 4 weeks in total. I went here to complete my reqwuirement for P.E and to take my Korean 2 class to also complete my language requirement this year as well. Suffice it to say, it was not a good experience. First of all, I HATE waking up early, especially during times where I have typically have the opportunity to sleep in. Next, I wrenched my back on the Monday of the 2nd week while playing goalie in soccer. In the very last week on Tuesday, I got a cold that stayed with me for the remainder of the time. Overall, I think it was worth it, but hopefully it'll also be the last time I experience this.

## Visiting "The Big Three"

The Summer in California does not bode well in terms of the weather, but that didn't stop me from visiting what I call "The Big Three". This is my nickname for Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farm, and Six Flags Magic Mountain, the three biggest amusement parks in CA! While I may not have any pictures from there, here are my three experiences at them, from the beginning of Summer to the end.

* Six Flags

  + I went to Six Flags  with my mom on the Tuesday before I started Summer School, and I have to tell you it has become my favorite of The Big Three! It was here when I first discovered my love for rollercoasters... or the ones with one loop/corkscrew or less anyway. The park is so magnificent in all ways from the location to the rides! Speaking of which, my favorites are Revolution and Ninja, followed closely by Jet Stream and Gold Miner. Every trip there gets even more fun, and I hope to go back very soon!

 * Knotts Berry Farm

   + I went to Knotts Berry Farm two weeks after I left Summer School with my mom. I was actually there not long ago celebrating my dad's birthday in February, but this time, I stayed for 3 days and 2 nights in the Knotts Berry Farm Hotel. On the first night, we actually went down the street to Medieval Times, which is basically a show set in medieval Spain with 6 different factions, and they compete in assorted games including jousting. My faction didn't win, but it was still fun anyway. The next day, we actually went into the park to have fun. However, we decided to get the Fast Pass after entering the park to the avoid two hour lines. It was definitely worth it because we got to ride everything we wanted to at least twice! My favorite ride there is the wooden rollercoaster known as Ghostrider, which we rode 4 times. That same night, we had dinner at the official chicken place where I enjoyed Chicken and Dumplings. It was nice to finally be back to the hotel, especially after the renovations. This was definitely a trip that will stick with me for a while.

* Disneyland

  + On the last week before school started, I went to my dad's house early to go to Disneyland the next day. We woke up very early to get there in time for the rope drop so we can get to see the Star Wars land first. I haven't been to Disneyland since 2018, so I was dying to finally see it as a Star Wars fan. Even though we were outrun by a good portion of the crowd, we still got to Rise of the Resistance before most people, and it was easily the best ride there! It first starts by being escorted into a Resistance ship, whichI suspect is an elevator that leads you down into a Star Destroyer that "captures" you. Then, you are escorted to prison cells that eventually lead to cars propelled by magnets, which truly did enhance the experience. Everything in there was EXTREMELY detailed and the magnetic track really boosted the thrills. Afterwards, we went on the other Star Wars ride and some classics such as Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted Mansion, Jungle Cruise, and more! At the end, I got a large Baymax plushie as a souvenir, which was a perfect end to such a beautiful day!

 ## Savory Summer: My Favorite Eats

 As we all know, one of the most crucial parts of any Summer is the delicious food we get to eat along the way. My Summer is no exception, as my Summer is never complete without eating these three things at least once every year!
 
* American BBQ

  + Personally, I think nothing goes better with Summer in America than good old barbecue. I recently got to experience some fine barbecue in a store named Charlie Brown Farms, which is located somewhere in the desert. At this market, I got try some exquisite brisket and pulled pork. Overall, both of these were very tender and very juicy, making it a top tier experience. The best part is that they also serve tri-tip, chicken, and burnt ends, all of which are also classics in the world of American barbecue. Overall, I just think BBQ in the Summer just hits differently and is definitely an icon of the season.

* Mexican Food

  + Being part Mexican, the food down South has been very prevalent in my life as I have eaten many of its dishes and variants for years. This year, my family held a Carne Asada, which is basically a Mexican barbecue, in the middle of July. At this party, many dishes such as tacos, enchiladas, pozole, quesadillas, and many more were served! To add on to the experience, some of these foods, like the enchiladas, were my grandma's recipes. My grandma passed away from Covid-19 in 2022, so I felt like ever since, her food has been even more delicious, and it showed with fresh ingredients and amazingly balanced flavors, just like she used to make them. I feel like you can never go wrong with such cuisine, especially in a Californian Summer.

* Sushi

  + My all time favorite dish: Sushi! Sushi has been my favorite dish since I was 7, and it has only been enlarging ever since. This Summer, me and my dad finally found a new all you can eat sushi spot near our house. The selection there ranged from very traditional sashimi to American favorites. From what I remember, we ordered gyoza, which are fried pot stickers, mussels, shrimp and tuna nigiri, a baked scallop roll, along with multiple other selections. My expectations were high because I have been eating sushi for more than half my life now, and you must believe me when I say the fish was so fresh! It tasted like the fish was just caught mere hours ago, and the ingredient combinations were off the charts! That has easily been the best sushi experience I've ever had so far, and I will definitely return there for another meal.

## My Summer Music Picks

This Summer, I was finally introduced to Spotify for the first time ever. WHile these are nothing new, I have taken time out of the Summer to curate a small-ish list of songs I love, and here are my Top 4 picks of the Summer.

* ["Black Thunder" by The HU (feat. Serj Tankian and DL of Bad Wolves)](https://open.spotify.com/track/7qDVR7dlgSBpHPw7tqcO3d?si=gxq_e1vmSZeyHJZYagPZaw)

  + Now, I didn't even know this band existed until I saw them on YouTube first. The HU is a Mongolian Rock band that incorporates Rock with Mongolian Traditional Music, and I have to say it is a match made in heaven. This is easily my favorite song out of all of them, and I can't wait to see what they do next! Be advised that a good portion of this song is sung in Mongolian, much like many of their other songs.
  
* ["Flight of Icarus - 2015 Remaster" by Iron Maiden](https://open.spotify.com/track/3vhKrSxe3fRuS5Ogis76VO?si=NsmCtwlPTuad-kVs6NIwjg)

  + Iron Maiden is easily my favorite band of the genre, and I strongly believe that "Flight of Icarus" is one of their best and most catchiest songs. As a history and mythology buff, this is definitely one of my favorites and one I couldn't leave out.
  
* ["Folsom Prison Blues" by Johnny Cash](https://open.spotify.com/track/0LTSNmOLBt25GMjHlxp9OR?si=P30IsZGtQ5ygNtdSaUwgmA)
  
  + I grew up listening to many Country and R&B classics, but I am a firm believer that Johnny Cash definitely takes the cake in both of them! All of his songs always have a rhythm and structure that I could get addicted to, and this song is no different. It is not as popular as some of his other songs such as "Ring of Fire" and "I Walk the Line", but this one is still underrated in my opinion, and one you surely must listen to.

* ["ITEM" by Stray Kids](https://open.spotify.com/track/1EWTsgQAEsUrnQ8iawhDSN?si=w38VfAQMSpmYpn7M_7g9Vw)

  + After mentioning only Rock and Country songs, you probably wouldn't expect me to include a K-pop song in this list, but that is where you would be wrong. This song is special to me because it played a crucial role in one of my major projects in Korean last year. Not only that, but it is also a song that easily gets me dancing and is created by the only K-pop group I listen to since they also incorporate Rap elements into most of their songs, which also captivates me.

## New Comic Coming Soon?

Over the break, I have been working on a concept to create a new comic series inspired by Lord of the Rings. The concept is centered around a newly recruited knight named Percival, or Percy for short, who is finally living his dream of being a night. However, Percy must venture out of his home country into other lands on the continent as they are corrupted by a mysterious evil steming from an unknown land. He must befriend wizards, bandits, and exiles alike in order to defeat the corruption that has spread across the continent and is slowly reaching his home kingdom, which is the last place the corruption has yet to spread. As they clear the lands, they must collect artifacts to unlock the path to the central mountain that houses a map to the land where this corruption stems from and destroy it. Not only that, Percy and his friends also slowly learn of a greater power inside them, and slowly unlock it to defeat the corruption. I am still in concept development for the later comics, and my progress is bound to be greatly slowed now that school has started again, but I hope to start working on the books themselves by the beginning of next semester.

## A Bittersweet End

As much as I hate to say, but all good things on this planet must come to an end. I'm truly sad about having to kiss this break goodbye, especially because I was still going to school for half of it. Nevertheless, I still managed to make many good memories over the break, and I'm happy that I get to see my friends again. Besides, it's not like I can't have fun on the weekends and days off during the year until next Summer Break comes around and more opportunities for new experiences and memories come knocking at our doors, and I'm sure we can all agree that it matters not where it ends, as long as we made good memories along the way.
