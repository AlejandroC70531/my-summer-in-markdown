# Summer Break 2024: The Firsts and the Fun

## Hello There!

I'm Alejandro! I'm currently in 10th Grade, and this repository is for my Computer Science class! I am a mixture of Mexican, German, Dutch, and Polish and I love to explore my roots. I am very passionate about world history, cooking, nature, and cultures from around the world. This is my first ever repository, so I hope you enjoy it. I will now dive into certain topics relating to what I did this Summer!

## Summer School

This year, I took my first ever Summer School class for 4 weeks in total. I went here to complete my reqwuirement for P.E and to take my Korean 2 class to also complete my language requirement this year as well. Suffice it to say, it was not a good experience. First of all, I HATE waking upo early, especially during times where I have typically have the opportunity to sleep in. Next, I wrenched my back on the Monday of the 2nd week while playing goalie in soccer. I typically don't play in that position and I had to contort my body weirdly in order to save the ball, which I did. However, this victory did not come without a price, as contorting my body in that fashion caused me to twist my back and sidelined me for 2 days.
