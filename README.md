## Hello There!

I'm Alejandro! I'm currently in 10th Grade, and this repository is for my Computer Science class! I am a mixture of Mexican, German, Dutch, and Polish and I love to explore my roots. I am very passionate about world history, cooking, nature, and cultures from around the world. This is my first ever repository, so I hope you enjoy it. I will now dive into certain topics relating to what I did this Summer!

## Summer School

This year, I took my first ever Summer School class for 4 weeks in total. I went here to complete my reqwuirement for P.E and to take my Korean 2 class to also complete my language requirement this year as well. Suffice it to say, it was not a good experience. First of all, I HATE waking up early, especially during times where I have typically have the opportunity to sleep in. Next, I wrenched my back on the Monday of the 2nd week while playing goalie in soccer. In the very last week on Tuesday, I got a cold that stayed with me for the remainder of the time. Overall, I think it was worth it, but hopefully it'll also be the last time I experience this.

## Visiting "The Big Three"

The Summer in California does not bode well in terms of the weather, but that didn't stop me from visiting what I call "The Big Three". This is my nickname for Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farm, and Six Flags Magic Mountain, the three biggest amusement parks in CA! While I may not have any pictures from there, here are my three experiences at them, from the beginning of SUmmer to the end.
