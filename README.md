## Hello There!

I'm Alejandro! I'm currently in 10th Grade, and this repository is for my Computer Science class! I am a mixture of Mexican, German, Dutch, and Polish and I love to explore my roots. I am very passionate about world history, cooking, nature, and cultures from around the world. This is my first ever repository, so I hope you'll enjoy it. For now, I will now dive into certain topics relating to what I did this Summer!

## Summer School

This year, I took my first ever Summer School class for 4 weeks in total. I went here to complete my reqwuirement for P.E and to take my Korean 2 class to also complete my language requirement this year as well. Suffice it to say, it was not a good experience. First of all, I HATE waking up early, especially during times where I have typically have the opportunity to sleep in. Next, I wrenched my back on the Monday of the 2nd week while playing goalie in soccer. In the very last week on Tuesday, I got a cold that stayed with me for the remainder of the time. Overall, I think it was worth it, but hopefully it'll also be the last time I experience this.

## Visiting "The Big Three"

The Summer in California does not bode well in terms of the weather, but that didn't stop me from visiting what I call "The Big Three". This is my nickname for Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farm, and Six Flags Magic Mountain, the three biggest amusement parks in CA! While I may not have any pictures from there, here are my three experiences at them, from the beginning of Summer to the end.

* Six Flags

  + I went to Six Flags  with my mom on the Tuesday before I started Summer School, and I have to tell you it has become my favorite of The Big Three! It was here when I first discovered my love for rollercoasters... or the ones with one loop/corkscrew or less anyway. The park is so magnificent in all ways from the location to the rides! Speaking of which, my favorites are Revolution and Ninja, followed closely by Jet Stream and Gold Miner. Every trip there gets even more fun, and I hope to go back very soon!

   + I went to Knotts Berry Farm two weeks after I left Summer School with my mom. I was actually there not long ago celebrating my dad's birthday in February, but this time, I stayed for 3 days and 2 nights in the Knotts Berry Farm Hotel. On the first night, we actually went down the street to Medieval Times, which is basically a show set in medieval Spain with 6 different factions, and they compete in assorted games including jousting. My faction didn't win, but it was still fun anyway. The next day, we actually went into the park to have fun. However, we decided to get the Fast Pass after entering the park to the avoid two hour lines. It was definitely worth it because we got to ride everything we wanted to at least twice! My favorite ride there is the wooden rollercoaster known as Ghostrider, which we rode 4 times. That same night, we had dinner at the official chicken place where I enjoyed Chicken and Dumplings. It was nice to finally be back to the hotel, especially after the renovations. This was definitely a trip that will stick with me for a while.

* Disneyland

  + On the last week before school started, I went to my dad's house early to go to Disneyland the next day. We woke up very early to get there in time for the rope drop so we can get to see the Star Wars land first. I haven't been to Disneyland since 2018, so I was dying to finally see it as a Star Wars fan. Even though we were outrun by a good portion of the crowd, we still got to Rise of the Resistance before most people, and it was easily the best ride there! It first starts by being escorted into a Resistance ship, whichI suspect is an elevator that leads you down into a Star Destroyer that "captures" you. Then, you are escorted to prison cells that eventually lead to cars propelled by magnets, which truly did enhance the experience. Everything in there was EXTREMELY detailed and the magnetic track really boosted the thrills. Afterwards, we went on the other Star Wars ride and some classics such as Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted Mansion, Jungle Cruise, and more! At the end, I got a large Baymax plushie as a souvenir, which was a perfect end to such a beautiful day!

 ## Savory Summer: My Favorite Eats

 As we all know, one of the most crucial parts of any Summer is the delicious food we get to eat along the way. My Summer is no exception, as my Summer is never complete without eating these three things at least once every year!
